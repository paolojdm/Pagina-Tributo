        <h3 id="headline">Here is a timeline of the life of NCIS Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1954</strong> born on November 21 in Stillwater, a small town in Pennsylvania</li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1991</strong> - his first wife, Shannon, and daughter, Kelly, were murdered while he was abroad engaged in the Gulf War and their
            death will profoundly affect Leroy Jethro, pushing him to join NCIS Not long after returning from Iraq he was honorably discharged from
            the Marine Corps with the rank of gunnery sergeant and joined the Naval Investigative Service, becoming part of Mike Franks' team,
            with whom he would become good friend
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> meeting a 25-year-old boy named Anthony Dinozzo, he helps him solve a case in Baltimore, later hiring him
            into NCIS on a permanent basis
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2003</strong> Foiling a terrorist attack on a plane, he meets Kate Todd and, amazed by her intelligence, hires her into NCIS,
            for him Kate will be like a second daughter
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - in a huge challenge to stop the terrorist Ari Haswari, he loses Agent Todd to a blow to the head, he will
            try to avenge her in all possible ways, until he meets the terrorist's sister Ziva David and makes her understand that her brother was
            on the side wrong, Ziva kills her brother, saving Gibbs' life
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong> During the investigation into the death of NCIS Special Agent William Decker which was believed to be due to natural
            causes but was likely homicide, Jenny Sheppard, director of NCIS and both Gibbs' friend and old flame, had planned to meet with Franks
            in a diner, but the assassins arrived first and Jenny, already suffering from cancer, died, this marked Jethro's life even more, who was
            not only angry with the criminals, but also with Jenny who had not told him nothing about the tumor, in this period the director of NCIS
            changed and there was, indefinitely, director Leon Vance
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - the team is always the same Gibbs, Dinozzo, McGee, an agent officially hired since 2005, Ziva, over the years the four
            have foiled terrorist attacks, made trips between Iraq and America, solved murder crimes (one of which it was too much noise), met Mike Franks,
            helped their medical examiners Doctor Donald Mallard (Ducky) and Doctor James Palmer (Jimmy), solved the murder case of Mike Franks' son, met
            the FBI agent Fornell, and his daughter Emily, however, a serial killer, believing Gibbs to be his main enemy, killed Mike Franks, another
            death that marked the life of Gibbs, who however managed to capture the serial killer
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013</strong> - after the death of Eli David, director of the Mossad, his daughter Ziva asks Gibbs for authorization to go to Europe
            where Bodnar, believed to be her father's killer, is located. In the meantime, a Mossad agent is killed and the new director (a woman of
            whom Ziva will reveal a long relationship she had in her youth with her father Eli David) is in the United States to collaborate in the search
            for Ilan Bodnar. Ziva and Tony leave for Europe, but not for Rome where everyone believes Bodnar is, but for Berlin where Ziva thinks Bodnar
            actually is, because that's where she can change her money into diamonds and then disappear. The investigations conducted in parallel by the
            Mossad, the CIA, the FBI and the NCIS, seem to be groping in the dark. In Berlin, Ziva and Tony instead of finding Bodnar find his brother who
            helps him. In the meantime it turns out that Ilan Bodnar never left the United States after the murder of Eli David, as the Mossad already knew,
            but had not revealed it to NCIS. Tony and Ziva then return to the United States with Bodnar's brother and, as soon as they arrive, they suffer a
            serious (intentional?) collision from an SUV.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014</strong> - Explosion at an event in Washington, the Secretary of the Navy is killed. The team is suspended from duty, due to Secret
            Service agent Parsons, but Gibbs is sent to Iran to investigate the case of the marine's head full of radiation, but once there Gibbs ends up in an
            ambush and is saved by Parsons. Agent Fornell informs the team that the attacks are the work of a terrorist group whose leader is Parsa. In the
            meantime, Di Nozzo tries to track down Ziva with whom he exchanges text messages. Not succeeding, he turns to Adam, Ziva's contact he met in Berlin.
            Ziva's traces lead to a safe house where, however, three bodies are found, but no trace of Ziva, only her necklace, a sign that she had been there.
            Tony is always looking for Ziva and decides to leave for Tel Aviv, upon his arrival he is contacted by the Mossad and begins to collaborate with Adam
            and the new director of the Mossad Orli Elbaz. During their research, Adam and Tony meet Ziva's old childhood friend, Dr. Bashan. The doctor tells Tony
            that she Ziva told her a lot about him the last time they met and she understood that she Ziva loves Tony. Meanwhile, the new Secretary of the Navy and
            the team investigate a terrorist group, whose target is a certain Mendez. Tony discovers that Dr. Bashan lied to him about Ziva and discovers that he won't
            get any help from her. Time passes and Tony managed to find Ziva, but hides this fact from his former teammates. The two try to clarify, but Ziva's position
            is adamant. Despite explicitly declaring her love for her, the woman is determined to change her life, due to a conversation she had with her friend.
            Meanwhile, the team manages to understand that the real attacker is Mendez himself, who Gibbs kills. Ziva and Tony say goodbye despite Tony's insistence that
            she come home with him. On the flight home Tony finds Ziva's pendant in his pocket. Eleanor Bishop (Elly) is hired at NCIS to replace Ziva
          
          <li>
            <strong>2016</strong> - Ziva is apparently killed by a mortar shell that destroys her house, fired on the orders of Trent Kort, whose objective was not her,
            but to eliminate the evidence of her crimes that Eli David had placed there. Gibbs doesn't look for her, believing her to be dead despite Tony's retorts. Tony
            discovers he has a daughter and moves to France. Nick Torres is hired
          </li>
          <li><strong>2019</strong> - Ziva David is in Gibbs' basement and warns him of imminent danger and wants to take him to a safe house. After a while, the two are
            attacked by an armed commando, but they manage to escape by building a homemade bomb, which kills one of the attackers. A piece of Ziva's coat remains at the scene,
            which Bishop recognizes. McGee soon realizes that something isn't right and immediately puts Bishop on the spot: the truth comes out.
            Ziva and Gibbs try to team up with Sahar.
            Ziva and Gibbs defeat the Sahar extremist organization that wanted her dead. She later discovers that the person at the head of the organization was another person,
            Sahar was Gibbs' neighbor Sara. Furthermore Sahar had a son "Phineas" who had become friends with Gibbs, and her life is once again put in danger, but with the help
            of Gibbs and the others she saves herself and, finally, frees herself from everything that prevented her from reunite with family.
            After warmly saying goodbye to everyone, she leaves for Paris to join Tony and Tali. Gibbs saved Ziva</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - Covid-19 arrives, everyone wears masks, Emily Fornell dies of an overdose, Tobias Fornell and Gibbs are destroyed, Gibbs beats a man guilty
            of killing around twenty dogs after using them in dog fights. Gibbs gets fired for abuse of power, gets one of those dogs and calls it Lucy, testifies in a criminal
            trial but despite all his good deeds, despite his medals, despite everything he has dedicated to NCIS , that small action of having beaten a man guilty of a crime,
            means that, despite his testimony, a criminal, guilty of Ponzi scheme fraud against the navy, is released. Luckily the team manages to find clues to arrest him and
            his wife for murder by commission, he as the instigator, she as the gun
          </li>

            <strong>2021</strong> - Gibbs e McGee si trovano in Alaska, dove hanno dato la caccia ad un serial killer contattato da una società locale. Finito il loro lavoro, Gibbs
            confida a McGee ed al direttore Vance di non aver intenzione di tornare a casa, ma di rimanere in Alaska. Quando gli viene chiesto cosa sta cercando in Alaska, egli si
            limita a dire di non saperlo: “Il mio istinto me lo dirà quando l’avrò trovato”. Proprio in quei luoghi Gibbs ammette di aver trovato un senso di pace che non provava
            da molto tempo ...
